## Results Summary

The final vitals + labs model demonstrates stable generalization across held-out
hospitals.

At a 0.5% alert rate (≈1 alert per 200 patient-hours), the model identifies
~18× more true cardiac arrest events than random selection using only routinely
available ICU data.

Trend features were evaluated but did not provide additional lift beyond lab
information.
