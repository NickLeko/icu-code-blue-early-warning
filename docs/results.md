## Summary of Results

The final vitals + labs model demonstrates stable performance across held-out
hospitals with meaningful enrichment at realistic alert rates.

At a 0.5% alert rate, the model identifies ~18× more true cardiac arrest events
than random selection, using only routinely available ICU data.
